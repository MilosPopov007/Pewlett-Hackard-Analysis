# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
HR Analysis of Pewlett-Hackard company (boasting several thousand employees), by using SQL standardized programming language with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin (as a gateway), in order to prepare Pewlett-Hackard  for large amount of employees leaving company ("baby boomers" begin to retire at a rapid rate) and positions that will be  needed  filled in the near future. A retirement package will be available for individuals who meet specific criteria.

## Results:
For this analysis I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), flowchart ( with "Primary keys", "Foreign keys" and "Data types" for each column) that highlight different tables and their relationships to each other.

This will be our base point for future data analysis and upcoming tasks.

The first step in handling this vast amount of data was to import actual employee data records from the CVS file  in order to perform SQL queries that will give us a clear picture of current employees and actions that HR needs to take in order to prepare  for the “silver tsunami” (many current employees reaching retirement age).
