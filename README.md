# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
HR Analysis of Pewlett-Hackard company (boasting several thousand employees), by using SQL standardized programming language with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin (as a gateway), in order to prepare Pewlett-Hackard  for large amount of employees leaving company ("baby boomers" begin to retire at a rapid rate) and positions that will be  needed  filled in the near future. A retirement package will be available for individuals who meet specific criteria.

## Results:
For this analysis I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), flowchart ( with "Primary keys", "Foreign keys" and "Data types" for each column) that highlight different tables and their relationships to each other.
